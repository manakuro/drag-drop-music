  "readme": "# Pre/Post hooks for leveldb\n\nIntercept put/delete/batch operations on levelup.\n\n## Warning - Breaking Changes\n \nThe API for implementing pre hooks has changed.\nInstead of mutating an array at once, the prehook\nis called on each change `hook(change, add)`\nand may call `add(_change)` to add a new item into the batch.\n\nAlso, attaching hooks to leveldb is now simpler\n``` js\nvar Hooks = require('level-hooks')\nHooks(db) //previously: Hooks()(db)\n```\n\n## Example\n\n``` js\nvar levelup   = require('levelup')\nvar timestamp = require('monotonic-timestamp')\nvar hooks     = require('level-hooks')\n\nlevelup(file, {createIfMissing: true}, function (err, db) {\n\n  //install hooks onto db.\n  hooks(db)\n\n  db.hooks.pre({start: '', end: '~'}, function (change, add) {\n    //change is same pattern as the an element in the batch array.\n    //add a log to record every put operation.\n    add({type: 'put', key: '~log-'+timestamp()+'-'+change.type, value: change.key})\n  })\n\n  //add a hook that responds after an operation has completed.\n  db.hooks.post(function (ch) {\n    //{type: 'put'|'del', key: ..., value: ...}\n  })\n\n})\n```\n\nUsed by [map-reduce](https://github.com/dominictarr/map-reduce) \nto make map-reduce durable across crashes!\n\n## API\n\n### rm = db.hooks.pre (range?, hook(change, add(op), batch))\n\nIf `prefix` is a `string` or `object` that defines the range the pre-hook triggers on.\nIf `prefix' is a string, then the hook only triggers on keys that _start_ with that \nstring. If the hook is an object it must be of form `{start: START, end: END}`\n\n`hook` is a function, and will be called on each item in the batch \n(if it was a `put` or `del`, it will be called on the change)\n`op` is always of the form `{key: key, value: value, type:'put' | 'del'}`\n\nPass additional changes to `add` to add them to the batch.\nIf add is passed a string as the second argument it will prepend that prefix\nto any keys you add.\n\nYou can check what opperations are currently in the batch with the third argument.\nDo not modify the `batch` directly, instead use `add`\n\nTo veto (remove) the current change call `add(false)`.\n\n`db.hooks.pre` returns a function that will remove the hook when called.\n\n#### unsafe mode\n\nnormally, pre hooks prevent you from inserting into the hooked range\nwhen the hook is triggered. However, sometimes you do need to do this.\nIn those cases, pass in a range with `{start: START, end: END, safe: false}`\nand level-hooks will not error. If you use this option, your hook must\navoid triggering in a loop itself.\n\n### rm = db.hooks.post (range?, hook)\n\nPost hooks do not offer any chance to change the value.\nbut do take a range option, just like `pre`\n\n`db.hooks.post` returns a function that will remove the hook when called.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
